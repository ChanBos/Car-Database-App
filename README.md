## Application Security

Helmet.js has been utilized to increase the security of the application. Helmet is a middleware for Express applications. It sets many different HTTP headers and aims to make applications more secure.

Adding these headers can help in avoiding attacks such as Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS), clickjacking, etc.
